Description

This series of folders and files relates to a research project examing the spatial diffusion of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) across the UK. 

The project has been built in the R programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) and relies on a number of packages to conduct the statistical analysis, notably the SPDEP package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html).

The analysis has been published in the Journal of Transport Geography and can be viewed at the following URL:

The folders contain the following resources which will allow for the replication of the analysis presented in the paper. 

Data: contains spreadsheets of the data utilised in the analysis, with the "Integrated_Spreadsheet_contiguous.csv" being the most important one

Shapefiles: contains files which define the spatial characteristics used in the analysis

Code: contains the R scripts utilised to perform the analysis

Paper: contains a version of the paper describing the results of the analysis

In order to conduct the walkthrough, follow these steps

[1] Load the project file "EV.Rproj" located in the PEV folder into RStudio
[2] Import the dataset 'Integrated_Spreadsheet_contiguous.csv'
[3] start to run the code, I suggest line-by-line
