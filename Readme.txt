Description

This series of folders and files relates to the production of a research project examing the spatial diffusion of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) across the UK. The project has been built in the R programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) and relies on a number of packages to conduct the statistical analysis, notably the SPDEP package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html).

In order to preproduce the research, open the EV.Rproj file in a session of R-studio (https://www.rstudio.com/).

The project folders contain the following files:
Code: R scripts which specify the different stages of the analysis
Data: spreadsheets which record observations of variables examined in the analysis
Shapefiles: geometric arrangements of the spatial units
